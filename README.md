# PHP FPM 5.3 + Nginx Docker Image

While the offical [PHP Docker repository](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/php/) only provides PHP 5.4+, this image creates a PHP FPM 5.3 environment useful for some legacy systems. This image is based on the Debian Squeeze, which can install PHP FPM 5.3 very easily.
